# MLOps: Machine Learning Operations

## Overview

This repository showcases the MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline Iâ€™ve developed, which focuses on streamlining the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models. The goal is to improve the efficiency of model training, deployment, and lifecycle management in a real-world production environment.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `mlops_pipeline.py`: Main script for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- `model_config.yaml`: Configuration file for model parameters and settings.
- `dockerfile`: Dockerfile to containerize the MLOps pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `ml_model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model after training.
- `model_monitoring.py`: Script for model performance monitoring in production.

## ðŸŽ¯ MLOps Pipeline Goals

### **Automation**
- Automate model training, testing, and deployment to minimize manual intervention.
  
### **Scalability**
- Build a pipeline that scales with large datasets and complex models for production.

### **Monitoring**
- Implement model performance monitoring to ensure ongoing effectiveness post-deployment.

### **Versioning**
- Maintain version control of models, datasets, and pipeline steps for reproducibility and traceability.

## ðŸ§  Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean and preprocess data, ensuring that itâ€™s ready for model training.
  
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train machine learning models using pre-defined configurations, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
  
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Model Deployment**:
   - Containerize the model using Docker and deploy it to a cloud environment or local server.

5. **Model Monitoring**:
   - Implement monitoring to track model performance over time (e.g., changes in accuracy, drift detection).

## ðŸ”¨ Tools & Technologies

- **ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (depending on the model)
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes in code, models, and datasets
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration (if applicable)
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud (if applicable)
- **Monitoring**: Custom scripts for model performance tracking, Grafana for visualization (if applicable)
